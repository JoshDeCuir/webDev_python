<h1>Python Recipe App</h1>
  <p>
  Welcome to the Python Recipe App! This project will guide you through the basics of 
  Python programming by building a command-line recipe application. Throughout this journey, you'll 
  learn essential concepts such as data types, operators, functions, file handling, and exception handling.
